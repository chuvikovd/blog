## Hi, my name is Dmitrijs

This is the first post in this blog, and for some time it will be kind of "About me" page.

### Who I am

I am professional frontend developer from Latvia. I have strong background in developing small to large scale web applications, mostly using `React`. I also have good experience working with `Redux`, `GraphQL`, `Typescript`, not to mention `HTML & CSS`.
At my everyday work I am on the road to fullstack developer with `Ruby on Rails` backend.

### What is this blog about

In this blog, I plan to write about things that I don't usually do at work - trying different frameworks and libraries, maybe start a pet project and document its development.
First step in trying new stuff is done - this page is powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev), and also [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) and first posts will be about how it was, so stay tuned.
